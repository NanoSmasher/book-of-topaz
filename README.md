Book of Topaz
=============

A blog derived from [Lemma](https://github.com/neizod/lemma-theme).

About
-----

This blog is an assortment of websites, apps, programs, tricks I gathered or have been recommended over the years (mainly on the digital side). By fusing that knowledge with my polished high-class bookmarks, this collection has been remodelled to be a useful directory for the following characteristics of this blog:

1. **Service**

Say you want to send a big file to somebody, or maybe a little touchup on a file without installing some clunky software. These are most common problems you will stumble upon and hope I hope my choice is a convinently filtered answer.

2. **Ephiphany**

This is going to fill that hole in your heart you never knew you had.

3. **Numbers**

Numbers, datasets, word sets, inputs and outputs there is something to just play around with.

4. **Trash**

So I have a good chunk of bookmarks and a lot of them are dead/garbage but someone else out there might like it. Bookmarks also capture a moment in time, and everything from the date to the title I used says a lot. Maybe some reminiscencing of the past with a plenty sprinkling of anecdotes.
