About
-----

I like to recommend a lot of different programs, apps, and tricks to my friends. But now I want to share it with everyone. It is not a typical review/advert as it will provide more subjective experiences. For websites and programs I would go over the evolution of the interface and features from my perspective, whereas for neat tricks I write about the frequency and maybe how I stumbled upon it. To create some sort of structure, I have divided the website into these catagories:

1. **Service**

Say you want to send a big file to somebody, or maybe a little touchup on a file without installing some clunky software. These are the more common problems to come across and hopefully you will remember my suggestions here.

2. **Epiphany**

This is going to fill that hole in your heart you never knew you had. Or more of the uncommon problems you would likely not face.

3. **Numbers**

Numbers, datasets, infographs, inputs and outputs there is something to just play around with.

4. **Refinery**

So I have a good chunk of bookmarks and a lot of them are dead/garbage but someone else out there might like it. Bookmarks also capture a moment in time, and everything from the date to the title I used says a lot. Maybe some reminiscing of the past with a plenty sprinkling of anecdotes.

5. **Personal**

As I find good opportunities to talk about special websites and stuff with lots of heart and soul, these are the bookmarks I have saved in anticipation that someone else would enjoy what I enjoy. Who knows? I won't unless I initiate it ~
