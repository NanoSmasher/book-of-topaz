	<p>This blog is an assortment of websites, apps, programs, tricks I gathered or have been recommended over the years (mainly on the digital side). By fusing that knowledge with my polished high-class bookmarks, this collection has been remodelled to be a useful directory for the following characteristics of this blog:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><b>Service <i class="fa fa-lg fa-bolt"></i></b>
	<p>Say you want to send a big file to somebody, or maybe a little touchup on a file without installing some clunky software. These are most common (or uncommon) problems you will stumble upon and hope I hope my choice is a convinently filtered answer.</p></li>
	<li><b>Ephiphany <i class="fa fa-lg fa-bomb"></i></b>
	<p>This is going to fill that hole in your heart you never knew you had. </p></li>
	<li><b>Numbers <i class="fa fa-lg fa-cubes"></i></b>
	<p>Numbers, datasets, infographics, inputs and outputs there is something to just play around with.</p></li>
	<li><b>Refinery <i class="fa fa-lg fa-sun-o"></i></b>
	<p>So I have a good chunk of bookmarks and a lot of them are dead/garbage but someone else out there might like it. Bookmarks also capture a moment in time, and everything from the date to the title I used says a lot. Maybe some reminiscencing of the past with a plenty sprinkling of anecdotes.</p></li>
	<li><b>Personal <i class="fa fa-lg fa-bookmark"></i></b>
	<p>As I find good oppotunities to talk about special websites and stuff with lots of heart and soul, these are the bookmarks I have saved in anticipation that someone else would enjoy what I enjoy. Who knows? I won't unless I initiate it ~</p></li>
